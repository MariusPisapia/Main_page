    <h2 class="text-center">My favorite Studio Ghibli film</h2>
    
    <img src="https://www.lesgrandsclassiques.fr/images/princessemononoke_0.jpg" alt="Princess Mononoke">
    <h4>Princess Mononoke Synopsis</h4>
    <p>The story takes place in medieval Japan (Muromachi era). Ashitaka, the prince of the Emishi tribe, a reclusive people in northern Honsh≈´, is struck with a curse after killing Naggo, a boar god turned demon: his arm is animated by supernatural strength, but is eaten away by the demonic entity. The village shaman tells him that he is doomed to die and advises him to leave the village in order to go west to seek the cause of nature's anger and the hope of finding the reason for his curse. </p>

    <h4>Why I like this film :</h4>
    <p> Princess Mononoke is my favorite anime. What I like in this movie is the universe, it's a fantasy universe which takes place in a past period. In this movie the nature is very present, we can find a lot of animals but also spirits from the Japanese mythology. It's an action movie with sequences on a luxuriant forest which seems immense and infinite. The drawings are faithful to the animation of studio Ghibli, the details and the play of light seem real, we have the impression to see a real movie. The main character is a young man who has been cursed and who travels the country following the order of the shaman of his village: "to look at the world without hate". During his journey Ashitaka faces the ravages of war on men but also on nature. The film does not have a moralizing goal but we understand that the author wants to put forward the importance of preserving nature because without it we are nothing. The film has many battles and fights, the animation is well done. Thank you for taking the time to read my review of this film, and I hope that it has made you want to watch it. üòú</p>
